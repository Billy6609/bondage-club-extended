# BCX Changelog

## 0.4.1

This update includes:
 - Two new toggleable cheats for giving the user pandora or mistress padlocks and keys
 - Added chat commands for batch cursing and lifting of curses
 - Added BCX version information and external link to the changelog in the BCX main menu

Fixes:
 - Reduced transparency of the BCX icon over the in-game characters for better visibility on various room backgrounds
 - Fixed how the command trigger was displayed in the chat commands help for the user

## 0.4.0

This update includes:
 - A whole new chat command system to interact with BCX users, even if you don't have BCX!
   The new commands can be seen by whispering `!help` to any BCX user.
   You can use most of the commands on yourself too. To see those, use `.help` in chat.
 - Added tutorial message for chat commands. This will not display for current users, so to give you the contents:
> BCX also provides helpful chat commands.
> All commands start with a dot ( . )
> The commands also support auto-completion: While writing a command, press 'Tab' to try automatically completing the currently typed word.
> Other club members can also use commands of your BCX, without needing BCX themselves. They will get a list of all commands they have permission using by whispering '!help' ( ! instead of . ) to you.
> Note: Messages colored like this text can only be seen by you and no one else.
> 
> To dismiss this message, write '.he' and press 'Tab' to complete it to '.help', which will show you list of available commands.
