# Bondage Club Extended (BCX)

An extension for the Bondage Club online game ([https://www.bondageprojects.com/club_game/](https://www.bondageprojects.com/club_game/)) by Jomshir98, one of the club's coders.

It enhances the experience in the club with many new features, especially more options for slaves/submissives and their owners/dominant play partners.

The extension can, among other things, be considered a continuation of Ace's wonderful [cursed script](https://github.com/ace-1331/ace12401-cursedscript), providing similar features. Ace recently announced that the development of Curse will be stopped. Jomshir98, who was also a contributor to the cursed script's github, offered to take over the development to not let Curse die due to incompatibility with new club versions. At the same time, the goal was to remake the underlying design from the ground up, to make the script more future proof. Therefore, the decision was to integrate curse features into the bondage club extended script.

This has several advantages: There is no longer any need to install a browser addon and keep it up-to-date. BCX is a simple script, where the latest version can automatically be run via a simple loader in the console or with a browser bookmark (see section ['running the script'](#running-the-script)). Moreover, the new design will make it easier to configure and expand the extension with new exciting features.

BCX is a complete remake of Jomshir98's previous [JMod](https://github.com/jomshir98/testing) which was basically all about testing features Jomshir developed for the bondage club, before they were even part of any BETAs, such as BEEPs with messages attached or icon-based room movement.

The extension is very modular and highly customizable. The following modules are planned:
1. Basic - the base configuration of the extension, including managing permissions for other players (e.g. dommes)
2. Behavior Logging - a record book for breaking any rules or other events of interest for yourself or the player's dommes
3. Nicknaming Yourself - giving you a nickname that everyone in the club will see in the chat, profile, etc.
4. Nicknaming Others - everything on showing you other players only with a nickname set by you or others
5. Curses - cursing an item slot so a restraint or clothing stays on or off very securely
6. Actions - one time actions such as forcing you into a pose
7. Restrictions - toggleable conditions, e.g. forcing you continuously into a certain pose
8. Rules - your dommes can create and set rules for you that will be monitored by the extension
9. Speech - any actions, restrictions and rules about altering or enforcing speech, e.g. doll talk or understanding gag talk
10. Punishment - automatic punishments can be set by the dommes for breaking any of your rules
11. Miscellaneous - other nifty features such as restrained wardrobe access, mistress items, or a chat typing indicator on other BCX users
